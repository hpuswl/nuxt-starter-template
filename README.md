## Use only what you need

Fluffless doesn't mean "start with nothing". The goal of this template is to be an entry into maintainable apps.

**The essentials**

- Typescript, made easy with Next.js
- [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) for utility-first styling
- [next-pwa](https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa) for offline support

**Nice to haves**

- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) or similar for low stress theming
